.. description: A look over my experience in looking for a new data science job
.. type: text

Background
==========

I recently found myself in the position of having to look for a new job, in particular, a data science job.  When I started my search, I was confident that my experience, along with my eclectic background, would make me a prime candidate.  My confidence seemed to be well justified by the number of responses I was getting to my applications, but this was short lived.  Through a combination of observation and rejection, I began to get a better view of the current job market and employer expectations.  This brings me to the goal for this post.

My intention here is to provide an anecdote of my experience after having applied to around 60 jobs across multiple industries (medical, security, food service, financial and agricultural), having had dozens of interviews and even more screening calls over a five month span.

It's important to note that this is meant to be a window into things one might come across if they have aspirations for entering the data science workforce (or continue on from their current position) and I feel that learning from others’ experiences can be instrumental in having a more successful pursuit.  That being said, this is built from my personal experience and your milage may vary.

Rejection
=========
Rejection, I feel, is arguably the most important topic here so I want to bring it up at the beginning.  The first thing to note is that it sucks, especially when you were really interested in the job and put that extra bit of effort into the pursuit and it can have a huge impact on your morale.

I lost track of how many times I was rejected, and there are a few of things I want to mention around rejection; types of rejection, how to deal with it (both personally and professionally) and how it can impact both parties.

The most annoying type of rejection is the the kind where you're ignored, or even worse, ghosted.


Expectations

Recruiters

Interviewing

Remote Working
==============
In my experience, there are 2 categories of companies when it comes down to remote working; those that do it and those that don’t.

There are some that say things like *'we are open to it for the right candidate'* or *‘remote work is an exception’*.  I consider these companies to be in the *don’t do remote* camp.  Even if they do allow it for a small population, that makes me weary about **how** they do remote work and makes me nervous.
