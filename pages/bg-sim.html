        <h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
        Over the past few years I have become pretty obsessed with modern
        board games.  This may sound unusual to the uninitiated but modern
        board games have come a long way in complexity, theme and just
        overall entertainment.  I also find that board games are a great
        way to unplug these days and enjoy the company and conversation
        that comes with people gathered together to play a game.  It seemed
        only natural to combine my interest in board games with my interest in data analysis.

        <h4><strong>Motivation</strong></h4>
        The motivation behind this objective similarity service is that, while browsing
        BoardGameGeek, I often find myself wanting a list of similar games.  I picture
        this being something like a new section in the side banner that has other game
        characteristics.  I knew a potentially more useful list would be a 'recommendation
        list' but without having direct, speedy access to the underlying database as well
        as user ranked lists, it would very time consuming to gather the necessary data
        for a recommendation system.  With that constraint, I opted for an objective
        similarity system that would return a list of games that are similarity based off
        game characteristics rather than opinion.  This is that attempt.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's important to mention what this isn't - a recommendation system.  Some
        responses may not make immediate sense as to the game relation but under the
        confines of the game characteristics used, there may be more apparent
        similarities.  This isn't to say that the system is always correct, far from it,
        it's just that the results might not align with expectations because one might
        think of the games differently than the model does.

        <h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
        The method being used here is quite straight forward when all is said and done.
        This system uses Locality Sensitive Hashing to determine the similarity between
        games.  In particular it is taking into consideration the following game
        characteristics (as defined by BoardGameGeek):
        <ul>
            <li>categories</li>
            <li>mechanics</li>
            <li>families</li>
            <li>designers</li>
            <li>publishers</li>
            <li>minimum age</li>
            <li>minimum playtime</li>
            <li>maximum playtime</li>
            <li>maximum player count</li>
        </ul>

        For information around Locality Sensitive Hashing, I'd recommend this
        <a href="https://youtu.be/bQAYY8INBxg">lecture</a> and this
        <a href="http://unboxresearch.com/articles/lsh_post1.html">article</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        A key thing to note is that the hash table was built with data pulled on
        2018-06-27 and contained the top 6,000 or so games (ranked according to BGG).
        This means that the system will only be able to return similar games if they
        were in the the top 6,000 games at the time.

        <h4><strong>Future Work</strong></h4>
        I hope to be compiling a more thorough walk through of how this
        system was built.
        <br>
        I also hope to look into using the board game description along with some Natural
        Language Processing (NLP) techniques as another approach to determining game
        similarity.
