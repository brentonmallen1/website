I am currently a Data Scientist but my degrees are in Ocean Engineering
with a focus in underwater acoustic signal and image processing.  I
mention this only to convey that my mind is a logical one and it always
has been.  As far back as I can remember, I was tinkering, building and
taking things apart just to prove that manufacturers always put in extra
screws.  Which is why I went into a more logic driven career path.  But
I've always had a (forgive the pun) draw towards art.  I loved it and I
admired people who had this seemingly natural ability to create these
amazing drawings/paintings.  Quite honestly, I was envious of those people
because, in my head, my creative side was at odds with my logical
side.  When I would attempt a drawing, it would undoubtedly involve
geometric shapes and lines that were unappealing and didn't flow.  While
geometric artwork can be attractive, these however, were not.


[I feel I must state that I don't mean to say that artistic engineers
don't exist, in fact, one could argue that creativity in design is a
requirement for an engineer.  However, I would say that, most of the time,
design in the engineering world is more purpose/requirement driven than
artistically driven.]

I had this constant frustration of having the desire to create art but
convinced I hadn't the ability.  (I still feel this way, sometimes)  This
didn't stop be from sporadically trying though and I even attempted metal
artwork while working as a welder and machinist in high school and
college.  But things didn't really start to come together until a few years
ago.

What happened? you might ask.  Well, quite simply, I just started drawing
and painting (cue Shia LaBeouf's [inspirational](https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0)).  I started reading and
watching people paint and draw and they became my source of
inspiration.  Some of my key influences include [Mark Crilley](https://www.youtube.com/user/markcrilley),
[JJcanvas/BlinckArt](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlinckArt) and
Bob Ross.  Mark Crilley helped me understand the fundamentals and what it
takes to build a piece, JJcanvas showed me the possibilities and
Bob Ross convinced me that it was all possible.

So, with my inspiration in hand, I started small with a sketchbook to
keep a record of my progress and I even worked on some small
paintings.  I made sure to use cheap materials so I wouldn't feel like
I was wasting a bunch of money if I messed things up.

I never truly understood what Bob Ross meant when he would say things
like "you have to be brave now..." until I started painting.  It can
be quite stressful to put a lot of time and love into a background of
a painting just to go ahead and risk covering it with the foreground.

I practiced drawing and painting more and more, every chance I had when
I could make room in my small apartment.  After studying some
techniques, I found that I (like many others) really liked the impasto
styles of Van Gogh and Afremov.  So I started working and practicing in
that style which helped me to understand more about the use of brighter
colors and the importance of texture.

All the while, I was getting more and more comfortable with my technique and proud of the results
(even though others may not think I should).  I came to the point where I wanted to start using
better materials and even stretching my own canvas. Which brings me to my current piece, which I
haven't been able to work on as much as I would like.

At this point in my journey, I find myself more confident and I find myself
appreciating the beauty all around me, but it also goes a bit beyond that.  It
has been a journey of self discovery, of sorts, in both my artistic ability and as
well as my perspective on just about everything.  Hopefully, my example shows that
if you ever wanted to gain an ability that you once thought out of your reach, you
only need to find inspiration and just start.
