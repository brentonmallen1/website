I am an ocean engineer turned data scientist currently in the field
of cybersecurity.  I'm addicted to learning and I have way too many hobbies
which include: painting, photography, astronomy, underwater acoustics,
oceanography, music, metal fabrication, 3D printing, crochet, golf,
tabletop boardgames and many more.
